Okay so this is the tutorial on how to set this all up once you have ALL of the commands put into DBM

First,
You need to make sure where your bot is at on your computer the name of the folder CANNOT have spaces replace spaces with a '_'
Like so; https://vaalid.is-ne.at/Cn9LN.png

Secondly,
You're going to download the 'Auto_Responses.js' file and put it in your bots directory -
like so; https://vaalid.is-ne.at/HIXMl.png

Thirdly,
You're going to go to DBM and find the action 'Read File'(https://vaalid.is-ne.at/i77jd.png) you're going to have to locate all of these to make the commands work perfectly. Now you're going to edit the 'Path' location as seen in this image (https://vaalid.is-ne.at/V2yhs.png)

Fourthly,
If you don't know how to get a path location you can figure out by watching this short clip; https://vaalid.is-ne.at/4sD32.gif

Lastly, 
Once you get all of that set up everything should work perfectly fine, and you will be able to use these commands!
